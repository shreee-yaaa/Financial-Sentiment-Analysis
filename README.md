# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis
Financial Sentiment Analysis on Financial PhraseBank datasets classifying financial sentences into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

# Project Goal
The goal is to classify financial sentences into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments to aid financial analysis and decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset combines two datasets:

- **FiQA Dataset**: Contains financial text snippets with sentiment labels.
- **Financial PhraseBank**: A corpus of financial news phrases annotated with sentiments.

The data provides financial sentences along with their sentiment labels to help advance research in financial sentiment analysis.
